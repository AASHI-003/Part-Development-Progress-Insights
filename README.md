# Part-Development-Progress-Insights
Develop a part development dashboard to track each part’s phase, planned and actual start dates, and publish it online efficiently.


Objectives

Transparency: Provide a single source of truth for part development status across phases.
Schedule Control: Track planned vs. actual start dates to detect delays early.
Accountability: Assign owners and surface overdue/missing updates.
Efficiency: Automate data refresh and publishing to reduce manual effort.


Scope

In-scope data: Part master, program/project, development phases (e.g., Design, Prototype, Validation, PPAP, SOP), planned/actual start dates, owners, status, risks.
Out of scope (initial phase): Costing, procurement lead times, tooling lifecycle, quality non-conformance details (can be phased in later).
